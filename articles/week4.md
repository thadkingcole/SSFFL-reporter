# ESPN Fantasy Football Recap – Week 4

**Headline:** *3rd Down for What Finally Finds the End Zone, Avoids 0-17 Infamy*

After three weeks of misery, mockery, and meme-worthy meltdowns, *3rd Down for What* finally remembered that fantasy football is about scoring more points than your opponent. Powered by a miracle performance from Ashton Jeanty (32.5) and a revived Patrick Mahomes (26.3), the league’s perennial punching bag stunned the world with a 142.3-point outburst. Sure, it came against another basement dweller in *Taylor Got A Tight End*, but a win is a win. For the first time all season, we can’t roast *3rd Down for What* for being completely incompetent — just mostly incompetent.

Meanwhile, at the top, the league is a four-team dogfight with Carly, Cheesy's squad, and Remember the Titans all sitting at 3-1. Rice-a-Wrongee stumbles back to earth, Alex steadies the ship, and Kanishk keeps the lights on in the cellar.

Let’s break it all down.

## Game Headlines & Recaps

### **“Miracle in the Basement: 3rd Down for What Wins a Game”**

**3rd Down for What (1-3) 142.3, Taylor Got A Tight End (1-3) 116.78**
The league breathed a collective sigh of disappointment as *3rd Down for What* finally found a win, ending dreams of a perfect 0-14 season. Ashton Jeanty’s 32.5 points were nothing short of divine intervention, and even Bryan Irving chipped in 23.0. Mahomes looked like himself again with 26.3. For Taylor, Bijan Robinson (26.1) and Jordan Love (25.3) did their part, but their supporting cast couldn’t keep pace. Both teams are still buried in the standings, but only one got the sweet taste of victory this week — the one we least wanted to see succeed.

### **“Carly Climbs to the Top, Kanishk Crashes Deeper”**

**Carly’s Competitive Team (3-1) 128.0, Kanishk’s Kickass Team (1-3) 101.88**
Carly is living up to her team name, now sitting alone atop the league standings thanks to a balanced 128-point outing. Josh Jacobs (29.7) bulldozed his way through defenders, and Wyoming hero W. Marks (25.9) made sure the win was never in doubt. For Kanishk, the trend continues: McCaffrey (23.1) and London (21.0) shine, but everything else collapses like a cheap lawn chair. With the lowest scoring average in the league, Kanishk is proving “Kickass” is more ironic than accurate.

### **“Alex’s Awesome Team Lives Up to the Name”**

**Alex’s Awesome Team (2-2) 122.44, Rice-a-Wrongee (2-2) 86.38**
After a wobbly 1-2 start, Alex’s squad got back to .500 in convincing fashion, dismantling Rice-a-Wrongee. Bo Nix (25.7) and Quinshon Judkins (19.5) led the way as Alex posted a balanced, efficient week. Meanwhile, Rice-a-Wrongee looked more like Rice-a-Wrongagain, mustering just 86.3 points despite another solid outing from James Cook (21.0). Once looking like a powerhouse at 2-0, RaW has now dropped two straight and is searching for answers.

### **“Cheesy Statement: Ain’t Easy Being Cheesy Takes Down Titans”**

**Ain’t Easy Being Cheesy (3-1) 122.9, Remember the Titans (3-1) 111.96**
In the heavyweight matchup of the week, Cheesy delivered. Amon-Ra St. Brown (22.5) and O. Hampton (25.0) paced a deep roster that handled the previously undefeated Titans. Josh Allen (21.9) and Puka Nacua (29.5) kept things interesting for the Titans, but the supporting cast fizzled. With this win, Cheesy proves they’re more than a mid-tier snack — they’re a full-course meal.

   First loss of the season, but still a strong squad. Just not invincible.

   Back-to-back losses. Early dominance fading fast.

7. **Taylor Got A Tight End (1-3)** 📉
   Bijan can’t carry a roster alone. Needs consistency across the board.

## 🔥 Roast of the Week: *3rd Down for What*

Congratulations? I guess? After three weeks of being the league’s favorite punching bag, *3rd Down for What* put up the highest score of the season. But let’s not get it twisted — this was less “elite team turning the corner” and more “a blind squirrel finding a nut.” Ashton Jeanty isn’t dropping 32 every week, Bryan Irving isn’t a superstar, and Mahomes can’t carry you alone. This win just means you’ll pick ninth in the draft next year instead of first.

If anything, *3rd Down for What* robbed the league of what could’ve been a historic, undefeated winless season. The dream of 0-14 is dead, and honestly, that’s the biggest disappointment of Week 4.
