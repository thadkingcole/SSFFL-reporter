### **Game of the Week: Ain’t Easy Being Cheesy 120.26 – Rice-a-Wrongee 108.02**

The cheddar was sharp this week. Ain’t Easy Being Cheesy handed Rice-a-Wrongee their first loss of the season in a duel of heavyweights. Jonathan Taylor (31.3) tried his best to keep RaW afloat, but it wasn’t enough to overcome Cheese’s balanced attack featuring J. Mason (23.6), Kyren Williams (18.2), and the consistent superstar Amon-Ra St. Brown (17.2).

For RaW, this isn’t panic-button time yet — at 2-1 they’re still near the top of the standings. But Cheesy just sent a message: *don’t sleep on dairy*.

### **Remember the Titans 118.92 – 3rd Down for What 88.76**

At this point, it’s not even fair to call these “matchups” when 3rd Down for What is involved. This team is 0-3, hasn’t cleared 100 points all season, and is essentially serving as the league’s weekly stress-free scrimmage opponent.

Remember the Titans coasted to victory behind Josh Allen (21.02) and Puka Nacua (17.3). They didn’t need to break a sweat — the Colts defense scored almost as much as Mahomes (16.0 vs. 11.16). That’s right: 3rd Down for What turned *Patrick freaking Mahomes* into a background note.

The bright spot? Jaleel McLaughlin (20.0) looked decent. The rest of the roster? More like a collection of waiver-wire fliers and “maybe next week” excuses. Honestly, 3rd Down for What is so bad that ESPN’s servers considered auto-renaming their team to “Waiver Wire Simulator.”

### **Taylor Got a Tight End 88.22 – Kanishk’s Kickass Team 78.62**

Finally, a pulse from Taylor Got a Tight End! After two weeks of disappointment, they notch their first win of the season. AJ Brown (19.9) and Baker Mayfield (16.72) led the way in what can only be described as “winning ugly.”

For Kanishk’s Kickass Team, the stat line is brutal: only two players above 12 points (Kyren Williams 29.12, McCaffrey 19.0) and absolutely no help elsewhere. When your kicker (Butker, 12.0) is your third-highest scorer, it’s a rough week.

### **Carly’s Competitive Team 108.54 – Alex’s Awesome Team 85.82**

Carly bounced back strong after a Week 2 loss, taking care of business against Alex’s Awesome Team. Jalen Hurts (25.04) and Jahmyr Gibbs (24.4) were explosive, while Jaxon Smith-Njigba (18.1) chipped in his best outing of the year.

Alex’s Awesome Team? Not so awesome this week. Nico Collins (18.4) and the Steelers D (15.0) were lone bright spots, but Bo Nix (11.42) reminded everyone that starting a rookie QB in fantasy is a dangerous game.

## **Updated Power Rankings (Week 3)**

*(because standings don’t always tell the whole story)*

1. **Remember the Titans (3-0)** – Undefeated, cruising, and looking like the early juggernaut.
2. **Ain’t Easy Being Cheesy (2-1)** – Statement win vs. RaW. Cheese is for real.
3. **Rice-a-Wrongee (2-1)** – Still elite, but got humbled this week.
4. **Carly’s Competitive Team (2-1)** – Name says it all. Always competitive, now dangerous.
5. **Taylor Got a Tight End (1-2)** – Momentum shift? Ugly or not, a win is a win.
6. **Kanishk’s Kickass Team (1-2)** – Star power but no depth. A McCaffrey injury away from disaster.
7. **Alex’s Awesome Team (1-2)** – Inconsistent QB play dragging them down.
8. **3rd Down for What (0-3)** – Dumpster fire. Pure comedy. The free square on everyone’s schedule.

## **Roast of the Week: 3rd Down for What**

Look, we try to find new material each week, but 3rd Down for What keeps writing the jokes themselves. Three weeks in, three losses, and not a single performance over 100 points. This isn’t a fantasy football team — it’s an elaborate piece of performance art about failure.

Their best player this week was *Jaleel McLaughlin*. If you had to Google him, you’re not alone. Meanwhile, Patrick Mahomes — a guy who’s supposed to carry entire franchises — has been reduced to scoring less than the Colts defense.

At this point, 3rd Down for What isn’t competing with the rest of the league. They’re competing with history books, chasing the rare and shameful dream: the **perfect 0-14 season**.
