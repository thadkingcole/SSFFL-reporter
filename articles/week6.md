### **League Office Update: The Shutdown Drags On**

The league office remains dark, lit only by the glow of spreadsheets and broken dreams. Funding has not yet been restored, but the work goes on — fueled by cold coffee, civic duty, and a healthy dose of resentment.
Reports indicate that Commissioner morale is “fragile but operational.” Players have begun submitting reimbursement forms for emotional damage. And while no paychecks have gone out, *3rd Down for What* somehow cashed in another W, proving once again that chaos is the perfect habitat for mediocrity turned momentum.

## **GAME OF THE WEEK: “3rd Down for What” Finds a Pulse**

**3rd Down for What (3–3)** – *129.88*
**Ain’t Easy Being Cheesy (4–2)** – *96.74*

Someone check the temperature of the underworld — *3rd Down for What* has won **two straight**.

After spending the first month of the season impersonating a malfunctioning Roomba, the once-hopeless squad pulled off another convincing win, this time dismantling *Ain’t Easy Being Cheesy*, a team that clearly underestimated its opponent.

Mahomes finally looked like Mahomes (28.48 pts), Dowdle erupted for 31.9, and even the Denver defense showed up with 17 points — something Denver fans haven’t seen since the Obama administration.

Cheesy, meanwhile, melted under the bright lights. Skattebo’s 30 points were wasted as the rest of the roster collectively turned in the fantasy equivalent of a shrug. Sources close to the franchise report growing unease about their status as “pretenders in a contender’s body.”

And yet, in a move shocking analysts and irritating league veterans, *3rd Down for What* has reached .500. If there’s a lesson here, it’s that even a broken clock is right twice a season.

## **Carly’s Competitive Team (5–1)** – *132.52*

**Remember the Titans (4–2)** – *87.1*

Carly continues her campaign of cruelty, this week dismantling *Remember the Titans* with cold precision.

J. Jacobs and J. Smith-Njigba combined for 55.7 points, and Jalen Hurts casually chipped in another 17.6, further cementing *Carly’s Competitive Team* as the most ruthlessly efficient outfit in the league.

Meanwhile, *Remember the Titans* looked less like a championship hopeful and more like an inspirational sports movie that ends with a “we tried our best” montage. D’Andre Swift and Derrick Henry both produced, but it wasn’t nearly enough to stop the juggernaut.

Postgame, Titans management promised to “reevaluate preparation methods” — which analysts believe is code for “light a candle and hope the fantasy gods stop bullying us.”

## **Rice-a-Wrongee (3–3)** – *98.26*

**Kanishk’s Kickass Team (1–5)** – *65.5*

*Rice-a-Wrongee* rebounded in what can only be described as the fantasy football equivalent of a mercy win.

Kanishk’s Kickass Team failed to live up to its name yet again, scoring just 65.5 points — the lowest output of the week, and possibly the season. McCaffrey (20.6) and Warren (15.3) tried, but the rest of the roster appeared to be on a bye week in spirit if not in fact.

Rice-a-Wrongee didn’t need fireworks to get the job done. A consistent trio of Taylor, Chase, and Mayfield handled business, while the team’s bench players reportedly spent the game playing Minesweeper.

The Kickass Team is now 1–5 and facing serious questions about whether “Kickass” remains a legally permissible descriptor.

## **Taylor Got a Tight End (2–4)** – *114.86*

**Alex’s Awesome Team (2–4)** – *99.34*

It was a much-needed win for *Taylor Got a Tight End*, who climbed out of the basement thanks to the dynamic duo of Bijan Robinson (32.8) and De’Von Achane (29.0).

Alex’s Awesome Team, however, continues to test the elasticity of the term “awesome.” Pickens (27.3) and Daniels (18.6) delivered, but the supporting cast folded faster than a congressional budget proposal.

Taylor’s Tight End now rises to 6th place, still below .500 but firmly in the mix. When asked for comment, their head coach replied, “We’re just trying to have fun out there.” League insiders translated that to mean, “We’re desperately trying not to finish below *3rd Down for What*.”

### **League Office Closing Statement**

With no end to the government shutdown in sight, league officials continue to work unpaid, filing stats by candlelight and using an old flip phone as a hotspot.

When asked if operations could continue under these conditions, the Commissioner replied:

> “As long as 3rd Down for What keeps winning, nothing makes sense anyway. We might as well keep going.”
