### 🏈 **Fantasy Focus Weekly: Week 7 & Midseason Awards Special**

*By the unpaid yet essential League Insider*

As we hit the halfway point of the season, the league’s hierarchy is starting to take shape — or, in some cases, collapse spectacularly. Week 7 was a statement week for contenders, a cry for help from the cellar dwellers, and, unbelievably, another chapter in the redemption arc of *3rd Down For What*.

Let’s break down the action before we hand out the midseason hardware.

### **Game of the Week: 3rd Down For What (110.84) def. Alex’s Awesome Team (72.44)**

It finally happened — *3rd Down For What* has won three straight. Some analysts are calling it a streak; others are calling it a clerical error. Whatever the case, this team that started the season like a toddler learning to walk has now stumbled into relevance at 4-3.

Patrick Mahomes led the way with a 25.24-point performance, though even he looked a little confused as to how his fantasy squad has clawed back to .500. Jaylen Warren (17.8) and Javonte Williams (18.3) chipped in, while Rico Dowdle — once a folk hero in this column — took a breather after weeks of carrying this franchise’s dignity.

Meanwhile, Alex’s Awesome Team put up a performance that was, well… not awesome. With just 72 points, it’s hard to tell if the issue was roster management, talent, or sheer cosmic punishment. Quinton Judkins (26.4) was the lone bright spot, but even he couldn’t salvage a lineup that looked allergic to touchdowns.

For *3rd Down For What*, this win may mark the first time in franchise history they’ve been described as “competent.” For Alex’s Awesome Team, it’s back to the film room — or maybe just a group therapy session.

### **Ain’t Easy Being Cheesy (135.28) def. Kanishk’s Kickass Team (95.84)**

Cheesy continues to melt opponents with quiet consistency. With Matthew Stafford (27.38) rediscovering relevance and Davante Adams (24.0) doing Davante Adams things, this squad remains a legitimate title threat.

Kanishk’s Kickass Team, on the other hand, is testing the limits of nominative irony. Christian McCaffrey (35.6) was sensational, but he’s beginning to resemble a one-man band forced to perform for an empty stadium. The rest of the lineup combined for a forgettable 60 points, and at 1-6, this team’s postseason hopes are flatter than their waiver wire activity.

### **Rice-a-Wrongee (141.82) def. Remember the Titans (101.08)**

A classic statement win. Rice-a-Wrongee, after a rocky 2-3 start, has rediscovered its rhythm and blown the doors off one of the league’s most respected franchises.

Jonathan Taylor (32.7) and Ja’Marr Chase (30.1) reminded everyone why they’re first-rounders, while the New England D/ST (20.0) scored more than half the players on *3rd Down For What*’s roster averaged in September.

The Titans — who began the year looking like juggernauts — were instead reduced to spectators in their own game. Trey McBride (24.4) was excellent, but the rest of the team looked like it left its playbook at home.

### **Carly’s Competitive Team (157.06) def. Taylor Got A Tight End (101.86)**

Another week, another demolition from Carly’s Competitive Team. At 6-1, CCT sits alone atop the standings, and the rest of the league is forced to reckon with their terrifying depth.

Jahmyr Gibbs (35.3) exploded, the Cleveland defense (24.0) smothered opponents, and Jaxon Smith-Njigba (22.3) continued his breakout season. If there’s a weak link here, it’s hiding better than *3rd Down For What*’s dignity after Week 2.

Taylor Got A Tight End, meanwhile, put up respectable numbers — but in fantasy, “respectable” only wins moral victories. Bijan Robinson (18.2) and A.J. Brown (26.1) tried to keep pace, but there’s no shame in losing to a team that’s playing chess while the rest of the league plays Go Fish.

## 🏆 **Midseason Awards**

### **🏅 Most Valuable Player: Josh Allen (Remember the Titans)**

Allen has been the league’s fantasy cheat code — a walking touchdown machine. Even when his team falters, Allen’s arm and legs keep his managers competitive every week.

### **💎 Steal of the Draft: Puka Nacua (Remember the Titans)**

Found in later rounds, Nacua has been the WR1 nobody saw coming. He’s carried the Titans through thin weeks and kept them relevant in the playoff picture.

### **🔥 Team of the Half: Carly’s Competitive Team (6-1)**

The league’s most consistent, balanced, and dangerous squad. Every week someone new steps up, and they’ve yet to show a single weakness. Rumor has it ESPN analysts are already comparing them to the 2007 Patriots — hopefully without the heartbreak.

### **💀 Bust of the Year (So Far): Kanishk’s Kickass Team**

When your name includes “Kickass” but your record says 1-6, the math isn’t mathing. Injuries, inconsistency, and general sadness have defined this team’s first half.

### **🗑️ Dumpster Fire Award: 3rd Down For What (Special Commendation)**

Now, hear us out. Yes, they’re 4-3. Yes, they’ve won four of their last five. But this award isn’t about wins — it’s about *vibes*, and *3rd Down For What* still reeks of chaos. Every victory feels accidental, every lineup decision inspired by dart throws. Their hot streak is impressive, sure — but it’s like watching a raccoon steal a sandwich: you’re amazed, but you still don’t respect it.

### **Commissioner’s Closing Thought**

At the halfway mark, parity reigns — or maybe chaos does. Either way, every team still has something to fight for (except maybe Kanishk’s Kickass Team).

As for *3rd Down For What*, we’ll acknowledge the win streak, but remain skeptical. Momentum’s a funny thing — one week you’re red-hot, the next you’re wondering if Rico Dowdle is still a real person.
