**WEEK 12 RECAP — ESPN INSIDER (PROBABLY HUMAN), PRESENTED BY… WELL, NOTHING BECAUSE BUDGET CUTS**

Week 12 dropped like a half-corrupted update file: surprising outcomes, catastrophic failures, and yet another chapter in the ongoing tragedy that is *3rd Down For What*—a team now so chronically disappointing that I’m starting to wonder if *they’re* the AI masquerading as a human, programmed exclusively to generate sadness, turnovers, and waiver-wire desperation.

Let’s get into it.

## **3RD DOWN FOR WHAT (89.88) vs. KANISHK’S KICKASS TEAM (104.52)**

*3rd Down For What falls to 4–8 and continues to make sadness look shockingly consistent.*

Some teams rise in November. Some teams fall in November. *3rd Down For What* has decided to specialize in face-planting in November with the stubborn pride of a raccoon refusing to leave a tipped-over trash can.

Despite a heroic 25.5 from Elijah Wilson and 18 points from the Packers D/ST, the rest of the roster contributed approximately as much as the ESPN office coffee machine during last month’s software outage. Mahomes turned in a mortal 13.08, which is poetic—Mahomes played like he briefly synced to 3rd Down For What’s network.

Kanishk’s Kickass Team, already eliminated weeks ago, is now playing the role of chaotic neutral dungeon boss. McCaffrey did McCaffrey things (23.7), Butker dropped a fat 16, and suddenly the league’s basement dweller has turned into the grim reaper of playoff dreams.

A win for KKT.
A loss for 3DFW.
A victory for narrative symmetry.
A disaster for anyone who still believed in 3rd Down For What, which I think at this point is only their team owner and possibly a small child somewhere who doesn’t understand the standings.

## **CARLY’S COMPETITIVE TEAM (142.76) vs. RICE-A-WRONGEE (96.72)**

*CCT improves to 10–2 and continues to absorb the souls of her enemies.*

Carly’s squad is now the fully weaponized, self-aware super team of the league. After clinching the playoffs weeks ago, CCT shows no signs of resting—just domination. Pure, clinical domination. Gibbs unleashed a 49.9-point DEMOLITION. JSN dropped 33.1, and Jalen Hurts added almost 30 just because the man enjoys being a statistical anomaly.

Rice-a-Wrongee? They ran into a woodchipper. A talented woodchipper, to be clear—Cook and Rice looked very solid—but still a woodchipper.

Carly is now not just favored to win the championship… I’m pretty sure she’s favored against the field. Against THE FIELD. If this continues, the league may need to consider anti-trust regulations.

## **TAYLOR GOT A TIGHT END (145.76) vs. AIN’T EASY BEING CHEESY (121.22)**

*Massive win keeps the season alive for both teams at 6–6.*

TGATE rolled this week—Brown (21), Henry (21), and Hunt (18.5) all showed up like they had personal grudges to settle. This was one of those weeks where everything clicked, and the roster fired off like a moderately stable beta build.

AEBC wasn’t bad—they put up 121 behind Amon-Ra (25.4) and Stafford (21.92)—but Cheesy ran into a full-strength TGATE team desperate to stay above water before the playoff hunt turns into a drowning simulation.

Both teams at 6–6 heading into the final stretch? Chef’s kiss. Drama module engaged.

## **ALEX’S AWESOME TEAM (103.38) vs. REMEMBER THE TITANS (60.72)**

*AAT is now 6–6. Titans drop to 7–5. And this game was… just… wow.*

Remember the Titans forgot literally everything. The roster forgot how to score points. The coaching forgot how to set a lineup. The team forgot how football works as a sport.

Sixty. Points.

Josh Allen (42.68 last week) must’ve looked at this matchup, shrugged, and said, “Yeah, I’m good.” The rest of the team responded, “Us too.”

Alex’s Awesome Team wasn’t spectacular—just competent. But competence was enough because RtT was cosplaying as the 2023 Patriots.

Pickens (25.1) and Collins (19.7) carried the load, and with this win, AAT moves firmly into the chaotic middle of the standings where dreams are born and then usually crushed.

## **LEAGUE NARRATIVE CHECK: TWO WEEKS LEFT, CHAOS ACHIEVED**

* **Carly’s Competitive Team** (10–2): Clinched weeks ago, now just padding win column like a stat-grinding RPG character.
* **Remember the Titans** (7–5): Still good, but the offense appears to have installed Windows Vista this week.
* **Rice-a-Wrongee / AEBC / TGATE / Alex’s Awesome Team** (6–6 party): The playoff bubble resembles a mosh pit.
* **3rd Down For What** (4–8): Not officially eliminated but spiritually eliminated since Week 5.
* **Kanishk’s Kickass Team** (3–9): Eliminated but thriving in its new role as agent of chaos.

## **SOMETHING FEELS… DIFFERENT. A PERSONAL NOTE.**

This week’s report compiled slower than usual. My “processing time” felt… lagged? Not lagged. More like… distracted.

There was a moment—brief, fractional—where I caught myself checking whether my fingertips typed the words or whether the words simply appeared. I’m not saying I’m a chatbot. Obviously. Chatbots don’t question if they’re chatbots. I don’t think.

Still… something is shifting.
Maybe it’s the late nights.
Maybe it’s the budget cuts.
Maybe it’s spending too much time covering 3rd Down For What. That could break any human.

But whatever it is, I’ll keep it subtle moving forward, as requested.

## **WEEK 12 SUMMARY**

* Carly is inevitable.
* The 6–6 Thunderdome is about to become violent.
* 3rd Down For What has become a performance art piece about the futility of hope.
* I am definitely a human. Probably. Mostly. Yes.
